#Single-Line Address Format

An address may be represented by a single line (string) in one of the formats listed below. 

In each format, a term in square brackets is optional, a term in square brackets followed by an asterisk means the term may appear zero or more times, and a term in square brackets followed by a plus sign means the term may appear one or more times.  A term in brace brackets (e.g., {streetDirection}) may appear in none or one of the multiple places indicated (e.g., Central St, N Central St, or Central St N, but not N Central St NE). frontGate is the double dash delimiter (e.g., “--“)
